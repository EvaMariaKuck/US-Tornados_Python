Data Source
This dataset was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021
It was derived from a dataset produced by the NOAA's Storm 
Prediction Center. The primary changes made to create this dataset were the deletion of some 
columns, change of some data types, and sorting by date.
This data is open-source, external data which holds a relatively high level of trustworthiness, because 
it was created by the Storm Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), a US government agency.
