## Objective 
This case study was performed for educational purposes as a part of a Data Analytics Course. The goal was, among other things, to identify variables which could explain the number of injuries caused by tornados.

## Data Source
Thes dataset was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021
It was derived from a dataset produced by the NOAA's Storm 
Prediction Center. The primary changes made to create this dataset were the deletion of some 
columns, change of some data types, and sorting by date.
This data is open-source, external data which holds a relatively high level of trustworthiness, because 
it was created by the Storm Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), a US government agency. 
The United States JSON file was downloaded from: https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A6/6.3/us-states.json
